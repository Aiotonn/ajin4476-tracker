Software Introduction:
This is a fitness assistance software that I designed and named Fit up, which is designed to help people achieve a healthy lifestyle and accomplish their fitness goals. The overall purpose of this fitness software is to provide a comprehensive platform for users to manage their fitness program, track their progress and maintain their motivation.  The software offers features such as personalized workout plans, nutrition advice, progress tracking tools and more. The target users are people of all ages and fitness levels who are looking to improve their health and fitness.  Whether they are fitness enthusiasts or beginners, my software provides the tools and resources needed to help them achieve their fitness goals. The goals of my fitness software are to:1.  help users set and achieve their fitness goals, whether it's to lose weight, gain muscle, or simply to live a healthier life.2.  provide users with personalized workout plans and optimize their fitness program.3.  make it easy for users to track their progress and monitor their results.4.  keep users motivated and active by providing a variety of features and tools. Overall, My Homemade Fitness is designed to be a user-friendly and efficient tool for anyone looking to improve their physical health and healthy living.

Iteration and development:
Many features were modified or removed from the initial plan, such as the login feature, which was added to the design during the creation of wireframe and was later removed because the assignment required that the login feature not be needed, and because it was considered that such a login feature might cause user dissatisfaction. This feature was also removed because of the user experience. Since this fitness software does not include the function of connecting to smart devices to monitor the user's workout in real time, the function of getting feedback from the user and updating the progress becomes difficult to implement. So I changed it to check off the completed items after the user completes a workout seems to be the best solution.

Future development directions:
Automatically generate recommendations that are more in line with the user's workout program, and give advice on diet, which will no longer be fixed and single. Beautify the background and improve the accuracy of the graphics in the web page, so that the pictures are shown in a dynamic form, which will help the user to understand the main points of the action.
